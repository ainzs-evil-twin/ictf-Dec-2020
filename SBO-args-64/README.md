# SBO-args-64

## Description

Just like the last time, try pwning this one. Note that the remote will not show you the errors or tell you the program terminated. So instead of hammering the remote, test your exploit locally with the file provided and make a fake flag.txt in the same directory as **sbo64**. Also, use **pwntools** to make the exploit.
